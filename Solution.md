# Solution Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the proposed solution to enhance system reliability, scalability, and security. It links to detailed documentation covering bottlenecks and risks, the new architecture, and the action plan.

## Key Objectives
- **Ensure High Availability (HA)** by introducing redundancy and failover mechanisms.
- **Optimize Storage** by migrating from NFS to AWS S3 with lifecycle policies.
- **Containerize Applications** for easier deployment and management.
- **Migrate to EKS** in a phased approach to leverage Kubernetes scalability.
- **Implement Monitoring & Security Tools** to enhance observability and compliance.

## Linked Documentation
